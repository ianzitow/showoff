# Showoff Tech Test

This application was created with Ruby on Rails 5.2. A wrapper was implemented to encapsulates a private API. A frontend built with React enable users to login, register, create widgets and see them. 

Some tests were performed with Rspec, however, due to time constraints, more tests would be nice to have, specially in the frontend.

To run the app, you'll need:
`rails c` in one terminal, and `./bin/webpack-dev-server`.
